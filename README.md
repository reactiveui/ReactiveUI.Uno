# What is ReactiveUI?

[ReactiveUI](https://reactiveui.net/) is a composable, cross-platform model-view-viewmodel framework for all .NET platforms that is inspired by functional reactive programming, which is a paradigm that allows you to [abstract mutable state away from your user interfaces and express the idea around a feature in one readable place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HwEytvngXk) and improve the testability of your application.

## Book
There has been an excellent [book](https://kent-boogaart.com/you-i-and-reactiveui/) written by our Alumni maintainer Kent Boogart.

## NuGet Packages

Install the following packages to start building your own ReactiveUI app. <b>Note:</b> some of the platform-specific packages are required. This means your app won't perform as expected until you install the packages properly. See the <a href="https://reactiveui.net/docs/getting-started/installation/">Installation</a> docs page for more info.
